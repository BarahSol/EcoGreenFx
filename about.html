        <h2>About EcoGreenFX</h2>
        <img src="./GreenFx50KG-removebg-preview.png" alt="product" class="invention">
        <p>
            <strong>EcoGreenFX</strong> is an innovative solution designed to address crude oil sludge contamination in soils through a synergistic approach involving co-planting and microbial bioremediation. Developed as part of a UKaid-sponsored Innovation to Market (I2M) program, EcoGreenFX integrates sustainable agricultural practices with environmental remediation techniques to restore soil health and enhance food security.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This novel approach leverages the natural pollutant-degrading properties of plants and microbes, combined with organic amendments like animal manure, to break down hydrocarbons and mitigate environmental pollution. By utilizing locally available resources, EcoGreenFX not only reduces remediation costs but also empowers communities to sustainably manage polluted lands.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            With its focus on ecological restoration, EcoGreenFX aligns with global sustainability goals, offering scalable solutions for environmental recovery in oil-contaminated regions while promoting resilient agricultural practices.
          </p>
        <h3>The Inspiration Behind EcoGreenFX</h3>
        <p>
          The inventor, Dr Uchechi Bliss Onyedikachi, saw the harmful effects of oil contamination on ecosystems and agricultural land. After extensive research and collaboration, EcoGreenFX was developed to harness nature's own resources to address this growing environmental issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          EcoGreenFX represents a fusion of innovative science, ecological awareness, and sustainability, aimed at transforming the way we restore polluted environments and support resilient farming practices.
